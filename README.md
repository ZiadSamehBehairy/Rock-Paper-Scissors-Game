# Rock–Paper–Scissors Game 🎮

## 📌 About the Project
This project is my **first practical project** in the **fifth course** of  
**Roadmap Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**.

- **Course Name:** Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 2  
- **Project Type:** Console Application  
- **Language:** C++  
- **Platform:** Windows (Console)

The goal of this project is to apply problem-solving concepts and strengthen my understanding of:
- Program design
- Game logic
- Functions and enums
- Input validation
- Clean and readable code structure

---

## 🎯 Project Description
This is a simple console-based **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game where:
- The player plays against the computer
- The computer choice is generated randomly
- The game runs for a user-defined number of rounds
- Final results are displayed at the end of the game

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
This project focuses on applying the following concepts:

- `enum` for defining game actions and results
- Functions to separate logic and responsibilities
- Input validation using loops
- Random number generation
- Game loop and score tracking
- Clean and modular code structure

---

## 🕹️ How the Game Works
1. The user selects the number of rounds
2. In each round:
   - The player chooses (Rock / Paper / Scissors)
   - The computer randomly selects its choice
   - The winner of the round is determined
3. After all rounds:
   - Total wins, losses, and draws are displayed
   - The final game result is shown
4. The user can choose to play again or exit

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Compiler:** MSVC
- **Environment:** Console Application

---

## 📈 Learning Outcome
Through this project, I practiced:
- Breaking down a problem into smaller functions
- Writing readable and maintainable C++ code
- Using enums to improve code clarity
- Handling user input correctly
- Implementing basic game logic

This project represents an important step in my learning journey and serves as a foundation for more advanced projects in upcoming courses.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Possible enhancements for future versions:
- Refactoring the game using `struct`
- Improving separation between logic and UI
- Adding difficulty levels
- Enhancing error handling
- Making the game cross-platform
