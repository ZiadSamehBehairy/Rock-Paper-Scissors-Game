# Rock–Paper–Scissors Game 🎮

## 📌 About the Project
This repository contains my **first beginner-level C++ project** completed as part of  
the **Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 2** course in the  
**Roadmap by Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**.

- **Course Name:** Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 2  
- **Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
- **Project Type:** Console Application  
- **Language:** C++  
- **Platform:** Windows Console

This project was created to practice basic programming concepts including enums, functions, control flow, and game logic.

## 🎯 Project Description
A simple console-based **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game where:
- The **player** plays against the **computer**
- The **computer choice is generated randomly**
- The user chooses how many rounds to play
- Final results (wins, losses, draws) are shown at the end
- The user can choose to play again

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
This project demonstrates:
- Use of `enum` types to define game choices and results
- Functions for modular code design
- Input validation with loops
- Random number generation
- Game loops and score tracking
- Clean and readable structure

---

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Compile the C++ code with any compiler (e.g., Visual Studio)  
3. Run the game executable  
4. Enter how many rounds you want to play  
5. Choose Rock (1), Paper (2), or Scissors (3) each round  
6. See the final results at the end

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio (recommended)
- **Compiler:** MSVC or any C++ compiler
- **Environment:** Console application

## 📈 What I Learned
During this project, I practiced:
- Breaking problems down into functions
- Using enums for cleaner code
- Handling user input safely
- Implementing simple game logic
- Writing clean and maintainable code

This project laid the foundation for more advanced projects later in the roadmap.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Potential future updates include:
- Adding difficulty levels
- Refactoring game logic into classes/structs
- Separating logic from UI
- Improving input validation
- Making it cross-platform
